Hello! 🍓

My name is **Tetra Silverberg**, and I'm currently a student of [W&M's Raymond A Mason School of Business's MSBA Program](https://mason.wm.edu/graduate/msba/residential/index.php) and an employee of [Port Technology Services](https://www.porttechnologyservices.com/). Outside of work and school, I play mostly ARPGs and factory management games.

This is a multipurpose personal GitHub page that I intend to use for a wide variety of projects, such as:
* 🧰 my [personal toolbox](https://github.com/tetraketra/TetrasToolbox) of useful R functions
* 💼 my version of [R's c() vector syntax in Python](https://github.com/tetraketra/PythonsRCool) making heavy use of special methods
* 🎨 my [generalized complex-plane escape-based fractal generator](https://github.com/tetraketra/FractalGenerator) that I coded from the ground up in Python
* 🤔 *more to come...*

**While I'll be documenting most of what I publish, I don't recommend using it yourself!**
