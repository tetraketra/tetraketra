Hello! 🍓

My name is **Tetra Silverberg**. I'm currently employed as a data engineer at [Port Technology Services](https://www.porttechnologyservices.com/), my pronouns are she/it (*yes you can make the joke*), I code mostly in Python and C, I read an unhealthy amount of manhwa, and my top three videogames are Spelunky 2, Factorio, and Path of Exile.

This is a multipurpose personal GitHub page that I use for a wide variety of personal projects, such as:
* 🧰 my [toolbox](https://github.com/tetraketra/tetras-toolbox) of useful Python functions (now available [here]((https://pypi.org/project/tetras-toolbox)) on PyPi)!
* 🎨 my [code golf](https://github.com/tetraketra/code-golf) adventures
* 🤔 *more in progress below...*

**While I'll be documenting most of what I publish, I don't recommend using it yourself!**
