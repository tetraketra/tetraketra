Hello! 🍓

My name is **Tetra Silverberg**, and I'm currently a student of [W&M's Raymond A Mason School of Business's MSBA Program](https://mason.wm.edu/graduate/msba/residential/index.php), employee of [Port Technology Services](https://www.porttechnologyservices.com/), and effective data tsar of [W&M's Miller Entrepreneurship Center](https://millercenter.mason.wm.edu/). 

This is a multipurpose personal GitHub page that I intend to use for a wide variety of purposes, such as:
* 🧰 My [personal toolbox](https://github.com/tetraketra/TetrasToolbox) of useful R functions
* 💼 MSBA program files (private for IP reasons)
* 🤔 More to come...

**While I'll be documenting most of what I publish, I don't recommend using it yourself!**
