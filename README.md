Hello!

This is my personal GitHub page for useful pacakages/functions and whatever I've meen messing with lately.
While I'll be documenting most of what I publish, I don't recommend using it yourself. 

<!---
tetraketra/tetraketra is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
