Hello, my name is **Tetra**! If you've found me through my resume, you may also know me as **Ben** (legal name). üçì

I'm currently employed as a data engineer at [Port Technology Services](https://www.porttechnologyservices.com/), my pronouns are she/it, I code mostly in Python and C, read an unhealthy amount of manhwa, and enjoy factory management games.

This is a multipurpose personal GitHub page that I use for a wide variety of personal projects.
